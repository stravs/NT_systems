      <h2 className="text-center">Black box</h2>
      <p>The black-box is the brain of the system, with <strong>unique smart software</strong> background providing smart functions. All components communicate to each other by <strong>CAN bus</strong> and black box has an overview of their status. Thus it is able to optimise the numerous parameters, <strong>make predictions</strong> on energy and power needs, <strong>optimise</strong> energy and fuel consumption, <strong>select smart mode</strong> (when to start range extender regarding prediction, SOC of battery, environment factors such as temperature, noise level, etc.), <strong>customisation</strong>, different <strong>pre-sets for different users</strong> and other more basic tasks. The optimization of best case scenario will not be based only on current driving parameters, but also on data of previous trips.</p>
      <p>The system is designed to function also without black box, and with <strong>redundancies in mind</strong>.</p>
      <br/><br/>
      <h2 className="text-center">User control </h2>
      <p>User control includes <strong>throttle lever and LCD touch screen</strong>. Throttle lever is <strong>simple and ergonomic</strong>, with all marine functions. Itâ€™s modularly built, supporting control over multiple motorizations and multiple stations. Touch screen is <strong>easy to use</strong>. It typically shows all important data on first page, and details on additional submenus. It shows all data from components connected through CAN bus, resulting in being used as <strong>handy tool</strong> for any service without major intervention.</p>
      <p>The system features also <strong>remote access</strong>, with additional hotspot or ethernet connection, which will allow a unique customer experience, remote system updates, customisations and <strong>customer service</strong>.</p>
