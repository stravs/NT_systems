      <p>The black-box is the brain of the system, with <strong>unique smart software</strong> background providing smart functions. All components communicate to each other by <strong>CAN line</strong>  and black box has an overview of their status. Thus it is able to optimise the numerous parameters, <strong>make predictions</strong> on energy and power needs (based on logged data), optimise energy and fuel consumption, <strong>select smart mode</strong> (when to start range extender regarding prediction, SOC of battery, environment factors such as temperature, noise level, etc.), current and circuit control, <strong>customisation</strong>, different pre-sets for different users and other more basic tasks. The optimization of best case scenario will not be based only on current driving parameters, but also on data of previous trips. </p>
      <p>Black box features a <strong>remote access</strong>, with additional hotspot or ethernet connection, which will allow a unique customer experience, remote system updates, customisations and customer service. The system is designed to function also without black box, and with redundancies in mind.</p>
