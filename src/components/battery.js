      <p>We made huge step forward in battery development. We are using innovative Lithium Titanate (LTO) cells and build in-house LTO-based batteries. They are the safest, can operate in the wide temperature range from -40°C to + 65°C and are very stable without thermal runaway effect. They have the 10x greater life cycle and cheaper price per life-cycle, comparing to other lithium chemistries. They can also be charged and discharged in 10 minutes, which is better than the state-of-the-art.</p> <p>LTO batteries are friendlier to the environment since the anode does not contain any carbon and there is also less overall waste. Upgrading the battery pack is very simple - existing battery’s performance is close to 100% for first few years and does not affect the performance of the new battery. This makes the retrofit very effective and reasonable. <strong>Disadvantage of LTO batteries (lower specific energy of 60-90 Wh/kg) is not actually a major problem in marine applications.</strong> The basic unit of battery pack will have 40Ah capacity at 331 Vdc, resulting in 13,2 kWh of energy. If the user needs higher power output or longer range, we can simply add additional battery, thus increasing energy capacity and maximum power output. Each user can build custom-made battery which best serves his needs. </p>
