      <p>NT Systems is an advanced next generation integrated electric propulsion system for emission-free commercial and leisure boating. Unique in being modularly built, designed to be just plugged-in without long installation, customizable in engine power and battery capacity, and equipped with smart software that automatically manages consumption levels, suggest travel modes, enables easy docking and can maintain boat position on the sea without anchoring. It also comes with affordable price.</p>

      <p>NT Systems tackles productivity challenges and extensive manufacturing costs of boat builders, by offering a cheaper and easy-to-install integrated system. This reduces threats to environment, caused by currently prevailing diesel-based boats in transport and coastal tourism sectors.</p>
