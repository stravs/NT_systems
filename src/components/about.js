      <h2 className="text-center">NT Systems is an advanced next generation integrated electric propulsion system for emission-free commercial and leisure boating.</h2>

      <p><strong>Unique</strong> in being modularly built, designed to be just plugged-in without long installation, <strong>customizable</strong> in engine power and battery capacity, and equipped with smart software that automatically manages consumption levels, suggest travel modes, and much more. </p>

      <p>Each component of the system (electric engine, battery bank, etc) is <strong>fully modular</strong> and ready to <strong>plug&play</strong>. The end user is able to choose the optimal solution (propulsion power, battery capacity, charging time, ...) for his own needs and each deployment is capable of being <strong>customized</strong>. Future scaling is also possible and very simple. Same as new installation, scaling is also plug&play. This makes the retrofit very effective and reasonable.</p>

      <p>NT Systems can be used in <strong>various applications</strong> where there is a need of reducing the pollution or the operating or manufacturing costs. <strong>Recreational and transfer boating</strong> is its initial roll-out market, including tourist or cargo <strong>transportation</strong> for river or channel crossing, small ferry, taxi boats, harbour applications, work platform/barges, service crew, marina crew, rescue crew, coastal diving centres, coastal security and police boats, smaller towing applications, by-boats for ocean cruisers or personal use, island cruising, fishing boats, leisure personal boats and yachts, sailboats and much more. It is also very convenient for <strong>eco-sensitive environments</strong> such as lakes, rivers, national parks, etc.</p>
