      <h2 className="text-center">NT Systems is an advanced next generation integrated electric propulsion system for emission-free commercial and leisure boating.</h2>

      <p>Unique in being modularly built, designed to be just plugged-in without long installation, customizable in engine power and battery capacity, and equipped with smart software that automatically manages consumption levels, suggest travel modes, and much more. </p>

      <p>Each component of the system (electric engine, battery bank, etc) is fully modular and ready to plug&play. The end user is able to choose the optimal solution (propulsion power, battery capacity, charging time, ...) for his own needs and each deployment is capable of being customized. Future scaling is also possible and very simple. Same as new installation, scaling is also plug&play. This makes the retrofit very effective and reasonable.</p>

      <p>NT Systems can be used in various applications where there is a need of reducing the pollution or the operating or manufacturing costs. Recreational and transfer boating is its initial roll-out market, including tourist or cargo transportation for river or channel crossing, small ferry, taxi boats, harbour applications, work platform/barges, service crew, marina crew, rescue crew, coastal diving centres, coastal security and police boats, smaller towing applications, by-boats for ocean cruisers or personal use, island cruising, fishing boats, leisure personal boats and yachts, sailboats and much more. It is also very convenient for eco-sensitive environments such as lakes, rivers, national parks, etc.</p>
